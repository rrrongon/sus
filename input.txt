r is a system for statistical computation and graphics it consists of a language plus a run time environment with graphics a debugger access to certain system functions and the ability to run programs stored in script files the design of r has been heavily influenced by two existing languages becker chambers and wilks s see what is s and sussman s scheme whereas the resulting language is very similar in appearance to s the underlying implementation and semantics are derived from scheme see what are the differences between r and s for further details the core of r is an interpreted computer language which allows branching and looping as well as modular programming using functions most of the user visible functions in r are written in r it is possible for the user to interface to procedures written in the c c or fortran languages for efficiency the r distribution contains functionality for a large number of statistical procedures among these are linear and generalized linear models nonlinear regression models time series analysis classical parametric and nonparametric tests clustering and smoothing there is also a large set of functions which provide a flexible graphical environment for creating various kinds of data presentations additional modules add-on packages are available for a variety of specific purposes see r add on packages r was initially written by ross ihaka and robert gentleman at the department of statistics of the university of auckland in auckland new zealand in addition a large group of individuals has contributed to r by sending code and bug reports r was initially written by ross ihaka and robert gentleman at the department of statistics of the university of auckland in auckland new zealand in addition a large group of individuals has contributed to r by sending code and bug reports since mid there has been a core group the r core team who can modify the r source code archive the group currently consists of doug bates john chambers peter dalgaard robert gentleman kurt hornik ross ihaka tomas kalibera michael lawrence friedrich leisch we ligges thomas lumley martin maechler sebastian meyer paul murrell martyn plummer brian ripley deepayan sarkar duncan temple lang luke tierney and simon urbanek r has a home page at https www r project org it is free software distributed under a gnu style copyleft and an official part of the gnu project gnu s$
